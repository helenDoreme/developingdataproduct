##**Welcome to Heart Disease Predication**

Heart Disease Predication is a Shiny application developed based on the [heart disease Cleveland database on UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data).

The database is obtained from UCI Machine Learning website, which contains 303 observations and 14 variables. To simplify the user input process, only 6 variables (Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Total Cholesterol, Heart Rate and Predication Value) are selected to develop this application. 

The processed dataset is partitioned into training and testing sets. The training set is trained with random forest method with cross validation and the predication accuracy is evaluated with the testing set. 

Heart Disease Predication can predict the risk factor of having a heart disease based on the input values, including Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Total Cholesterol and Heart Rate. Additionally, The user can select to display the Normal Range of Blood Pressure, the Normal Range of Total Cholesterol and/or the Normal Range of Heart Rate. 

The source code for this application is availabe on the GitHub.
